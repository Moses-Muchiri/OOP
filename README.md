# OOP Python Projects

## Description
This repository contains two interactive Python programs designed to demonstrate **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts including **classes** and **polymorphism**. These projects are part of my submission for the Python module under the **PLP programme**.

### 1. Superhero Builder ü¶∏
An interactive class-based program where users can create a custom superhero with unique powers, strength, and flight capabilities. It showcases inheritance and encapsulation.

### 2. Polymorphism Challenge üé≠
A simple vehicle simulation where different types of vehicles respond differently to the same `move()` method, illustrating polymorphism in action.

## Features

### Superhero Builder
- Create a unique superhero using user input.
- Choose between a regular superhero or a flying one.
- Demonstrates:
  - Class constructors
  - Inheritance (`FlyingSuperhero` inherits from `Superhero`)
  - Encapsulation (protected attributes)

### Polymorphism Challenge
- Choose a vehicle (Car, Plane, or Boat).
- Each vehicle has its own implementation of the `move()` method.
- Demonstrates:
  - Method overriding
  - Polymorphic behavior

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository** or download the Python files:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Moses-Muchiri/oop.git
   cd oop
   ```

2. **Run** Superhero Builder

  ```bash
  python class.py
  Enter the superhero's name, power, strength, and whether they can fly.
  ```
Watch your hero come to life!

3. **Run** Polymorphism Challenge

```bash
  python polymorph.py
  Choose a vehicle from the options shown.
```
Observe how each vehicle ‚Äúmoves‚Äù differently.
